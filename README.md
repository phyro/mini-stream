# Mini-stream

**The author is NOT a cryptographer nor has anyone reviewed the work. This means it's very likely a fatal flaw somewhere. This is meant only as an experiment and should not be used in production.**

This is an implementation of a minimal toy stream cipher. The implementation does not aim to be efficient and many cases are not covered. It's just me playing around.
